      Hi! I don't know how you stumbled onto this random corner of the internet.
      </br>
      My name is Gideon, I am a software developer and I make websites do stuff.
      </br>
      </br>
      I also really like learning stuff. I have spent a lot of my free time on youtube learning. There is a big community on youtube if you want to learn things. I have obtained a fair amount of general knowledge about stuff I find interesting. Here is a (non exhaustive) list of the things I like.
      </br>
      <ul>
        <li> Computers and how they work (duh) </li>
        <li> Science, including physics and chemestry </li>
        <li> Maths </li>
        <li> Technology </li>
        <li> Everything in Guns, Germs and Steel </li>
        <li> Artifical Intellegence (we are so screwed) </li>
        <li> How this experiment called society works </li>
        <li> Language; how we communicate </li>
        <li> Blacksmithing (dunno how I got into this one) </li>
        <li> Super cute animals being super cute! </li>
        <li> Other random stuff </li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      I sometimes think about the stuff I learn and try to talk a specific problem or topic through. I also want to get better at writing and explaining things.
      </br>
      Hopefully you find this at least mildy interesting.
      </br>
      I like cute animals so there might be a few :)
