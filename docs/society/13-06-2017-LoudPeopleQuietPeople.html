      <h1> Loud People, Quiet People </h1>
      There are loud people. There are quiet people. Loud people like to talk a lot and quiet people are polite, shy, have a quiet voice or don’t have confidence in their ideas.  I have found in many meetings that the loud people overpower the quiet people. The voice that gets heard is often the louder voices.
      </br></br>
      Which one are you?
      </br></br>
      So what?
      </br>
      Quieter people have opinions too. I love hearing from the quieter people in the room. They tend not to raise their voices to get themselves heard. They have much to contribute but they often don’t get heard.
      </br></br>
      There is a concept called the Anchoring bias https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring. Essentially what this means that that humans tend to agree on the first thing that is said in a conversation. Guess who usually speaks first? :)
      </br></br>
      Quiet people are usually introverts and loud people are usually extroverts. This is not always the case but there are many situations where extroverts tend to get their way because they are louder. I am looking at you drinking and partying culture.
      </br></br> 
      In your group see if you can identify the loud people and the quiet people. It really is not hard at all once you start paying attention to it. If you are a loud person try to be aware of it please!
      </br></br> 
      <h2> The interruption </h2>
      Quiet people tend to get interrupted by a louder voice. I have a loud voice when it is something I am passionate about. I am very aware of this and try really hard not to interrupt people. It happens though. So what can you do?
      </br></br>
      What can you do as an observer or a meeting runner when you see this happen?
      </br>
      One way is to use your loud voice and say something like “So (name of quiet colleague), you were saying?”. This works wonders! You get their opinion and they get to speak. Since you have used your voice to “interrupt” the room to give them space, they will be able to talk without feeling like they are interrupting. Obviously you shouldn’t do this all the time but it can help.
      </br></br>
      <h2> Avoiding Anchoring </h2>
      As I mentioned you can anchor thoughts in people’s head by saying a thing. Everyone starts thinking about that topic and not what they would like to say. It is hard to say anything concrete but one method I have found that works wonders is “silent brainstorming”.
      </br></br>
      Normally when you brainstorm you just shout out ideas. The loud people tend to win. You also get this anchoring effect that I have talked about. So, what is silent brainstorming?
      </br></br> 
      Silent brainstorming is where you all take 5 minutes (or however long is needed) to silently come up with ideas. I personally use post-it notes to achieve this. I pass them out to each person with a pen. You write one idea per post-it. After EVERYONE is ready you then go through the room and put your post-its on the wall/whiteboard and read them out. You cannot be anchored as you are hearing about other people’s ideas AFTER you have written your ideas down. Also, everyone gets their chance to talk. Trust me, quiet people talk in this format. It also forces the louder voices to form their opinions properly and not just blurting out the first thing they come up with.
      </br></br> 
      This technique is really useful for getting ideas from the entire group. There are strategies you can use to deal with all the ideas you get (a good problem to have :) ). I will mention them here briefly but at this point you have the ideas on the board.
      </br></br>
      <h2> Ideas to deal with the flood of ideas </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Grouping of similar post-its (can be done silently or out loud)</li>
        <li>Each person votes 3 times for the post-it’s they like and you discuss them in vote order</li>
        <li>Write them down on a document somewhere and come back to them</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      Hopefully this helps you get the most out of your quieter members and makes them feel included!
