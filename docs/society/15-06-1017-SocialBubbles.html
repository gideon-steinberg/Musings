      <h1> Social Bubbles </h1>
      I watch a lot of youtube. Youtube has a recommendations algorithm to find videos it thinks you will like based on your watch history.
      </br>
      I <strong>LOVE </strong> this feature of youtube. It allows me to see videos I like watching. I tend to watch the same type of videos and I think youtube knows what I like. These tend to be educational focused, with lots of facts in them. I also tend to recognise the channels I watch.
      </br>
      I have been trying to broaden my horizons but it is really hard to look for content when you don't know what to search for!
      </br></br>
      I have gotten into a few new things, for example blacksmithing. But that did not really last very long. It is now back to my normal scheduled programing of learning cool stuff about the world.
      </br></br>
      Then it happened. I looked at the videos in "Popular in (Area you live in)".
      </br>
      None of the videos were from channels I recognised. In fact I would go so far and say that NONE of the videos were what I normally watch.
      </br>
      This was today and I realised something, social bubbles are a real thing.
      </br></br>
      The other thing I realised was the fact that I actually did <strong>NOT</strong> want to watch any of the "popular" videos. Youtube's algorithm to find videos for me is working very well.
      </br>
      <h2>What is a social bubble?</h2>
      As you watch content recommendation systems will find out what you like watching. These recommendation systems are in everything, youtube, netflix, and facebook.
      </br>
      You will eventually find yourself trapped inside a specific social space. You only see things from that space. For me that is educational content. This is the "bubble" in the social bubble.
      </br></br>
      It is very hard to break out of a social bubble!
      <h2> So why do you care if you are trapped in a social bubble? </h2>
      Being in a social bubble you tend to only see one side of things. For me this means I get directed to positive content that I enjoy but it can be very different. 
      </br></br>
      I did not understand why until recently people did not see eye to eye in recent elections. Both sides lived in a social bubble and could not see the other sides point of view. They could not even consider why anyone would vote for the other side.
      </br>
      This has always been around to some degree but due to recent technology advances it is very very easy to get trapped in a social bubble.
      </br></br>
      Luckily for me the bubble I live in is not completely polical. I sometimes watch some political content and I am trying to tell youtube to stop it!
      </br>
      Youtube has a "not interested" feature in their recommendation system and I will probably write a further article if I can get youtube to knock it off.
      </br></br>
      I can see how that type of content makes you only see one view of the world and I have seen the light. I used to agree with one side. However I think this is because I am familiar with their views.
      </br>
      These are not views I want to hold and I am trying to get out of it. For me at least this only makes me sadder when I engage in this type of content.
      </br></br>
      Hopefully you can see the social bubble you are in and either accept it or try to break away. This is a real thing!
