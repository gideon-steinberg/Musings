      <h1> Solving a Rubik's Cube is not magic </h1>
      This is a rubik's cube:

      </br>
      If you cannot solve this then watching someone taking a rubik's cube and solving it seems like magic.
      </br>
      How can someone take a random scramble and put it back together in a neat order?
      </br></br>
      I can solve a rubik's cube in around a minute.
      </br>
      It is actually really easy. It kinda gets boring once you learn how to solve it.
      </br></br>
      There are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 number of states a rubik's cube can be in.
      </br>
      There is <strong>NO</strong> way to be able to solve it unless you know what you are doing.
      </br>
      One of these 43 quintillion states is the solved state. Your goal is to take one of these 43 quintillion states and move it to a specific one. This seems impossible but as I mentioned it becomes routine.
      </br>
      <h2> Properties of a Rubik's rube </h2>
      The first thing to do to learn to solve a rubik's cube is to understand it's properties. I will outline them here.
      </br>
      If you want the rubik's cube to stay a mystery stop reading :)
      </br></br>
      There are three types of pieces. They are:
      <ul>
        <li> The center pieces with one face </li>
        <li> The edge pieces with two faces </li>
        <li> The corner pieces with three faces </li>
      </ul>
      As should be obvious when you had a little play with one (or think about it) the pieces can only occupy specific slots based on what type they are.
      </br></br>
      The center pieces are not part of the puzzle. No seriously, you cannot move them. You can rotate them (which correspondes to the 6 moves you can make) but they do not move.
      </br>
      A rubik's cube solver is moving the edge and corner pieces in relation to the centers.
      </br></br>
      The edge pieces have 12 spots they can occupy and two orientations they can be in.
      </br>
      The corner pieces have 8 spots they can occupy and three orientations they can be in.
      </br></br>
      This type of puzzle is known as group theory in mathematics.
      </br>
      I won't go into the specifics but they is a <strong>LOT</strong> of mathematics research into group theory.
      </br>
      Essentially each move and set of moves transforms the cube from one group to another and you can model it in maths.
      <h2> How do you solve it? </h2>
      Simple, you build it step by step.
      </br>
      <ol>
        <li> Choose a colour to start with </li>
        <li> Move the 4 edge pieces of that colour in the correct spots </li>
        <li> Move the 4 corner pieces of that colour in the correct spots completing the first layer </li>
        <li> Move the 4 edge pieces in the second layout into the correct spots completing the second layer </li>
        <li> Orient the 4 edge pieces correctly on the last layer </li>
        <li> Position the 4 corner pieces in the correct place on the last layer </li>
        <li> Orient the 4 corner pieces correctly on the last layer </li>
        <li> Position the 4 edge pieces in the correct place on the last layer </li>
      </ol>
      Each step is done without destroying your progress from before.
      </br>
      You need to learn an algorithm (or series of algorithms) to move specific pieces without wrecking your hard work.
      </br></br>
      Step 2 and step 3 can be solved intuatively given some time but the rest require thought (or looking it up).
      </br>
      Step 2 is often known as "Cross" as you are making a cross.
      </br>
      Step 3 and step 4 can be done together in something called F2L (First two layers). This is just faster than doing them by themselves :)
      </br>
      Step 5 and 7 are known as OLL (orienting the last layer) which can be done as one step.
      </br>
      Step 6 and 8 are known as PLL (permuting the last layer) which can be done as one step.
      </br>
      Step 5,6,7 and 8 can be done in any order and they are done in different ways. The way I have given is just how I do it.
      </br></br>
      I don't do full OLL and full PLL. OLL has 57 distint cases and PLL has 21 distint cases and you need to memorise way too many algorithms.
      </br>
      I do two step OLL and 2 step PLL (in the order given above) as I only need to know 4 algorithms and it is pretty simple.
      </br></br>
      If you want to learn to solve a rubik's cube there are some resources below that explain exactly how to solve one.
      </br>
      Remember that you need to learn the muscle memory for these algorithms. I don't think about it anymore, I just do the algorithm to move pieces without thinking about it. I mainly think about "Where are those pieces again?".
      </br>
      There are also many other ways to solve it but they generally solve it step by step with specific algorithms.
      </br>
      This is called the beginners method.
      </br></br>
      I think I spoilt the magic, sorry if I did!
