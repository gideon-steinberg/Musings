      <h1> Ways to Prove Things Part One </h1>
      In maths things are proven to be true. How can you do this?
      </br>
      Maths is a logically field and so we need to use logic in order to prove things are true.
      </br>
      I find these methods quite interesting so I will be explaining a few ways to do so.
      </br>
      There will also be examples :)
      <h2> The Direct Proof </h2>
      This is the boring way of proving things. Basically take some things and do "maths" to them and prove something.
      </br></br>
      Example from wikipedia:
      </br>
      Proof that two even numbers (x and y) add together to get an even number.
      </br>
      Since x is even we can write x = 2a. (for some integer a)
      </br>
      Similarly y = 2b. (for some integer b)
      </br>
      x + y = 2a + 2b.
      </br>
      2a + 2b = 2(a+b).
      </br>
      2(a+b) = 2c and so is even. (for some integer c)
      </br>
      x + y is even. QED
      </br></br>
      Like I said, super boring.
      <h2> Proof by Contradiction </h2>
      Some things cannot be proved directly. We need to come up with other ways of proving things.
      </br>
      One such way is called proof by contradiction.
      </br></br>
      Essentially what we are trying to prove here is that something <strong>CANNOT</strong> be true.
      </br>
      The technique is quite brilliant, assume it is true and show that in such a system you run into a contradiction.
      </br>
      This is so beautiful because, while we cannot prove something is false, we instead prove it cannot be true.
      </br></br>
      <h3> Proof that the square root of 2 is irrational </h3>
      This proof is an often cited example of proof by contradiction.
      </br>
      I am going to give the algebraic version of this proof below but in the resouces there is a great video by vihart (the best mathemusician) explaining the geometric version (using the pythagorean theorem) of this proof.
      </br>
      Go watch all of her videos, seriously. Do it. You will not regret it! You do not need much maths background, you will learn!
      </br>
      Yes, there is a version of this proof that uses right angle triangles. It is beautiful.
      </br></br>
      Firstly what is an rational number?
      </br>
      A rational number is a number x that can be written in the form x = a/b where a and b are integers with no factors (called the simplest form).
      </br>
      If a and b have factors you an divide them by their common factor, say c, and get a/c = d; a/c = e; x = d/e.
      </br>
      I hope that makes sense, it will be important :)
      </br></br>
      An irrational number is a number that is not rational. i.e. it cannot be written in the form x = a/b where a and b are integers with no factors.
      </br></br>
      The proof:
      </br>
      Assume the square root of 2 is rational.
      </br>
      It can therefore be written in the form a/b where a and b are integers with no factors.
      </br>
      square root of 2 = a/b
      </br>
      2 = a^2 / b^2 (square both sides)
      </br>
      2(b^2) = a^2
      </br>
      Note a^2 is even as it has a factor of 2.
      </br>
      An even number times an even number is an even number. An odd number times an odd number is an odd number. There is a way to prove this (which I cannot remember) but think about it.
      </br>
      Since the only way to get an even number by multiplying the same number twice is to start with an even number, a is even.
      </br>
      a = 2c as it is even (for some integer c)
      </br>
      2(b^2) = (2c)^2
      </br>
      2(b^2) = 4(c^2)
      </br>
      b^2 = 2(c^2)
      </br>
      Note b^2 is even as it has a factor of 2.
      </br>
      b is even (see above)
      </br>
      a and b share a common factor of 2.
      </br>
      This is a contridiction of how we set a and b.
      </br>
      Therefore our assumption cannot be true as it leads to a contridiction.
      </br>
      Therefore the square root of 2 is not rational. Therefore it is irrational.
      </br>
      QED
      </br></br>
      This proof is a great example of how counter intuative this proof technique can be. I love it!
